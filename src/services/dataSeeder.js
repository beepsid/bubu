In your smile, the morning sun,
Every moment that we share,
Shows me how our hearts are one.

Your touch heals every scar,
In this world of endless faces,
You're my wish upon a star.

Forever yours, forever true,
My heart beats just for you.`,

Beautiful when you sleep at night,
Beautiful when you're laughing loud,
Beautiful in any crowd.

Beautiful when the day is chilly,
Beautiful in your favorite dress,
Beautiful in your sweet caress.

Every day I fall anew,
For beautiful, wonderful you.`,

Through joy and tears, through love and wrath,
Together we can face it all,
Together we will never fall.

Your dreams become my dreams too,
Your happiness, my morning dew,
In your arms I've found my home,
With you, I'll never be alone.

This love we share will never end,
My lover, partner, dearest friend.`,

But quiet mornings with coffee and toast,
The way you hum while doing your hair,
The gentle touch when you know I care.

Your sleepy voice when you wake up,
The way you hold your favorite cup,
These simple moments, sweet and true,
Are all the magic I need from you.`,
