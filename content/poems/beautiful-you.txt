Beautiful You
Beauty
Beautiful in the morning light,
Beautiful when you sleep at night,
Beautiful when you're laughing loud,
Beautiful in any crowd.

Beautiful when you're being silly,
Beautiful when the day is chilly,
Beautiful in your favorite dress,
Beautiful in your sweet caress.

Every day I fall anew,
For beautiful, wonderful you.
