My Heart's Song
Love
In your eyes I see the stars,
In your smile, the morning sun,
Every moment that we share,
Shows me how our hearts are one.

Your laughter fills the empty spaces,
Your touch heals every scar,
In this world of endless faces,
You're my wish upon a star.

Forever yours, forever true,
My heart beats just for you.
