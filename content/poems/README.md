## How to Add New Poems

1. Create a new `.txt` file in this folder
2. Name it descriptively: `poem-title.txt`
3. First line should be the title
4. Second line should be the category (Love, Beauty, Forever, etc.)
5. Rest of the content is the poem

## Example File: `my-hearts-song.txt`
```
My Heart's Song
Love
In your eyes I see the stars,
In your smile, the morning sun,
Every moment that we share,
Shows me how our hearts are one...
```

## File Structure
```
content/poems/
â”œâ”€â”€ my-hearts-song.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ beautiful-you.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ our-forever.txt
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

The app will automatically read all `.txt` files from this folder and display them in the poems section!
