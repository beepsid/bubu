Valentine's Day Magic ❤️
Today is our first Valentine's Day together, and I can't believe how lucky I am. Every moment with you feels like a dream come true. The way you look at me, the way you laugh at my silly jokes, the way you make even the simplest moments feel extraordinary. I love how we can talk for hours about everything and nothing. You make my heart skip a beat every single day.
