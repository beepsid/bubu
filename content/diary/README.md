# ðŸ“– Diary Entries

## How to Add New Diary Entries

1. Create a new `.txt` file in this folder
2. Name it with the date: `YYYY-MM-DD.txt` (e.g., `2024-01-15.txt`)
3. First line should be the title
4. Rest of the content is the diary entry

## Example File: `2024-01-15.txt`
```
The Day I Met You ðŸ’•
Today I want to tell you about the first time I saw you. Your smile lit up the entire room, and I knew in that moment that my life was about to change forever...
```

## File Structure
```
content/diary/
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024-01-15.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024-02-03.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024-02-14.txt
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

The app will automatically read all `.txt` files from this folder and display them in the diary section!
